SHORT FUNNY STORIES


Now That's What I Call Stupid:
    In my junior year of high school, this guy asked me on a date. He rented a Redbox
movie and made a pizza. We were watching the movie and the oven beeped so the pizza
was done. He looked me dead in the eye and said, "This is the worst part." I then
watched this boy open the oven and pull the pozza out with hos bare handsy rack and
all, screaming at the top of his lungs. We never had a second date.


Drama At My Drama Class:
    One time my drama class's teacher had gone home sick so we were just put in a
classroom with a movie to entertain us for the period when an alarm went off. None
of us were sure if it was the fire alarm or the lockdown alarm, so we all head out
into the hall to check and no one's out there, so we head back in and climb under
our desks as is lockdown procedure. Cut to an hour or so later when a teacher bursts
in and nearly dies of relief because the school was on fire and we were the only
students not accounted for and half the faculty and fire department had been
searching for us for ages. Literally, the whole school had filled with smoke while
we'd kept super safe under our wooden desks.
