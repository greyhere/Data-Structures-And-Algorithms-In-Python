### C-4.13

In Section 4.2 we prove by induction that the number of _lines_ printed by a call to `draw_interval(c)` is 2<sup>c</sup> − 1. Another interesting question is how many _dashes_ are printed during that process. Prove by induction that the number of dashes printed by `draw_interval(c)` is 2 <sup>c+1</sup> − c − 2.

> Base case,\
> f(0) = 2 + 0 - 2 = 0
>
> When you add 1 to c, you draw 2 iterations of the previous -> 2*f(c-1) and
1 line of length c.
>
> Therefore,\
> f(c) = 2 * (2<sup>c+1-1</sup> - (c-1) - 2) + c\
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 2<sup>c+1</sup> - 2 * (c-1) - 4 + c\
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 2<sup>c+1</sup> - 2c + 2 - 4 + c\
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 2<sup>c+1</sup> - c - 2
