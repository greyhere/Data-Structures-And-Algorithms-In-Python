''' R-4.8
Isabel has an interesting way of summing up the values in a sequence A of
n integers, where n is a power of two. She creates a new sequence B of half
the size of A and sets B[i] = A[2i]+A[2i+1], for i = 0,1,...,(n/2)âˆ’1. If
B has size 1, then she outputs B[0]. Otherwise, she replaces A with B, and
repeats the process. What is the running time of her algorithm?
